We algorithmically build a statistical model to solve a practical problem when we're given a dataset to work with. Our models would learn from a existing dataset and will give predictions for future values. 
It's like teaching the machine 1+1 = 2 and asking 2+2 = ?.
The more accurate our model predicts the results, the more accurate our model is. 

## Types of Learning
We have supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement methods to teach our model. 

### Supervised learning
In supervised learning, we deal with well established data and our machine learns on it. 

Here, the dataset is the collections of labeled examples
$${(x_{i}, y_{i})}^N_{i=1}$$where each element $x_{i}$ among $N$ is called a [[Feature vector]].
